# logistic-project-prototype-in-python
As I'm studying python, in addition to java, to be able to join an internship. Here is my first real project! It's not complete, it lacks a lot of information, but it's a prototype, a logistic system for small companies. If anyone wants to collaborate with my studies, I am grateful for the help. XD
